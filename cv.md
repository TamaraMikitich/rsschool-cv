## About Me
I'm 24 years old. I've been working in economics and finance for 5 years, but I realized that it wasn't my thing. That's why I want to change my profession. I have a little experience in HTML/CSS coding. This little experience has shown me the path I want to follow further. ***My goal*** is to actively deepen my knowledge and become a qualified frontend developer.

## Code examples

for (let i = 1; i < 21; i++) {
	console.log(i)

    }
    }
```
